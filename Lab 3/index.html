                    <p>Members of Dead Orbit intend to escape an already dying Earth before the Darkness's return, as they've given up on the Traveler and put little faith in the City's ability to hold out against a major attack. While they recognize that such a move could be very costly in terms of lives, they see no other alternative for survival, and instead put their faith in finding enough Golden Age technology in vaults and abandoned shipyards to allow them to escape and find a new homeworld.  </p>

                    <img src="Images/FutureWarCult.jpg" alt="Faction 2">
                    <p>The Future War Cult was once an outsider faction. When the Concordat faction fell from grace, the Future War Cult was selected to replace it in the Consensus and was granted access to the Tower. The Consensus felt that the Cult's philosophy was more interesting than dangerous, and its focus on combat would both attract former Concordat members and aid in the Guardians' effort to restore the City's territory</p>

                    <h2>New Monarchy</h2>
                    <img src="Images/NewMonarchy.jpg" alt="Faction 3">
                    <p>The New Monarchy rose from the chaos of the Faction Wars with a simple, inclusive guiding tenet: "Together we will rise." Leery of the fragile state of the City's politics, the New Monarchy maintains a watchful eye on the Speaker, the Consensus, and the Vanguard, seeking the leadership that will properly reign over the City and return civilization to its Golden Age splendor. To New Monarchy, if that leadership cannot be found, then it must be created. Members of New Monarchy are known for their ambition, drive and executive legal powers, New Monarchy arms and supplies the City's Guardians who are willing to fight to reclaim the solar system.</p>
